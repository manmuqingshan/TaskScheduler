### OVERVIEW:
A lightweight implementation of cooperative multitasking (task scheduling). An easier alternative to preemptive programming and frameworks like FreeRTOS. 

**Why cooperative?**

You mostly do not need to worry about pitfalls of concurrent processing (races, deadlocks, livelocks, resource sharing, etc.).  The fact of cooperative processing takes care of such issues by design. 

_“Everybody who learns concurrency and thinks they understand it, ends up finding mysterious races they thought weren’t possible, and discovers that they didn’t actually understand it yet after all.”_ **Herb Sutter, chair of the ISO C++ standards committee, Microsoft.**

**Main features:**
1. Periodic task execution, with dynamic execution period in `milliseconds` (default) or `microseconds` (if explicitly enabled) – frequency of execution
2. Number of iterations (limited or infinite number of iterations)
3. Execution of tasks in predefined sequence
4. Dynamic change of task execution parameters (frequency, number of iterations, callback methods)
5. Power saving via entering **IDLE** sleep mode when tasks are not scheduled to run
6. Support for event-driven task invocation via Status Request object
7. Support for task IDs and Control Points for error handling and watchdog timer
8. Support for Local Task Storage pointer (allowing use of same callback code for multiple tasks)
9. Support for layered task prioritization
10. Support for `std::functions` (tested on `ESPx` and `STM32` only)
11. Overall task timeout
12. Static and dynamic callback method binding
13. CPU load / idle statistics for time critical applications
14. Scheduling options with priority for original schedule (with and without catchup) and interval
15. Ability to pause/resume and enable/disable scheduling
16. Thread-safe scheduling while running under preemptive scheduler (i. e., FreeRTOS)
17. Optional self-destruction of dynamically created tasks upon disable
18. Support for "tickless" execution under FreeRTOS (continous sleep until next scheduled task invocation)
19. Support for both Arduino IDE stype (headers only) and PlatformIO style (Header + CPP files)
20. Support for non-Arduino platforms

Scheduling overhead: between `15` and `18` microseconds per scheduling pass (Arduino UNO rev 3 @ `16MHz` clock, single scheduler w/o prioritization)

**TaskScheduler** was tested on the following platforms:
* Arduino Uno R3, Nano, Micro
* ATtiny85
* ESP8266, ESP32
* Teensy (tested on Teensy 3.5)
* nRF52832, nRF52 Adafruit Core (tested on nRF52840 with v3.6.2 workround)
* STM32 (tested on Mini USB STM32F103RCBT6 ARM Cortex-M3 leaflabs Leaf maple mini module F)
* MSP430 and MSP432 boards
* Raspberry Pi (requires external `_TASK_NON_ARDUINO` and `_task_millis()` implementation)
* Any Linux (requires external `_TASK_NON_ARDUINO` and `_task_millis()` implementation - that's how Unit tests are done)

### User Feedback:

"I've used https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler with great success. Running LED patterns, monitoring button presses, reading data from an accelerometer, auto advancing to the next pattern, reading data from Serial. All at the same time." - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FastLED/comments/b3rfzf/wanna_try_some_code_that_is_powerfuldangerous/)

"There are libraries that do this automatically on Arduino too, allowing you to schedule [cooperative] multitasking and sleep the uC between tasks. E.g. https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler is really good, I've used it before. You basically queue up a list of task callbacks and a schedule in your `setup()` and then do a call to `tasks.execute()` in `loop()`, which pops off the next task that is due in a queue or sleeps otherwise. It's simple, but much more straightforward than manually using `if millis() - last > delta1... else sleep()` and not as rigid as using the timer ISRs (which really serve a different purpose)." - [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14848906)

"I took the controller with me on a business trip and spend the night getting the basic code framework out. It is going to run on top of Arkhipenko’s TaskScheduler. (https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler) This should help me isolate any issues between the different control systems while managing the different task’s timing requirements." - [here](https://hackaday.io/project/167479/logs)

"it's really cool and useful, for whenver you want your MCU to do more than 1 task" - [here](https://gitter.im/FastLED/public?at=5947e23dd83c50560c22d5b6)

"I encourage you to use it in the Arduino environment, it allows you to save a lot of time (and code lines) wherever you need to schedule, i.e. run many tasks that should to perform at different frequencies and when we want to have the greatest control over the performance of these tasks and we want good diagnostic of errors." - [here](https://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/topic3599980.html)

"arkhipenko/TaskScheduler is still my choice for now, especially when I get my pull request in, so we can have that idle 1 ms sleep feature for free." - [here](http://stm32duinoforum.com/forum/viewtopic_f_18_t_4299.html)

"The difference with milis is basically that you don’t have to be using logics to manage the executions, but the module itself does it. This will allow us to make code more readable and easier to maintain. In addition, we must take into account the extra functions it provides, such as saving energy when not in use, or changing settings dynamically." - [here](https://www.electrosoftcloud.com/en/arduino-taskscheduler-no-more-millis-or-delay/)



### Powering painlessMesh and ESP32 Mesh Networking

TaskScheduler is a core dependency of [painlessMesh](https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh) -- the widely adopted ESP8266/ESP32 mesh networking library. painlessMesh uses TaskScheduler internally to manage node discovery, connection maintenance, message routing, and mesh self-healing, all running cooperatively within a single `loop()` call.

This pairing of TaskScheduler + painlessMesh has been deployed across a range of real-world applications:

**Academic and industrial research:**

* **Air quality monitoring networks** -- Indoor/outdoor sensor mesh networks using ESP32 nodes with CO2, PM2.5, temperature, and humidity sensors, deployed across campus-scale areas (100m x 80m) and running continuously for days ([Sustainability, 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/24/16630))
* **Cold chain monitoring for perishable goods** -- PrunusPos project evaluating ESP8266 mesh testbeds for monitoring ambient conditions inside fruit and vegetable storage containers, with sensors integrated directly into transport crates ([Information, 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/13/5/210))
* **Mesh network performance evaluation** -- Multiple peer-reviewed papers benchmarking painlessMesh delivery delay, throughput, and scalability with varying node counts and payload sizes ([Yoppy et al., 2019](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335656647_Performance_Evaluation_of_ESP8266_Mesh_Networks))

**Community and maker projects:**

* **Synchronized LED installations** -- WiFi mesh-synchronized NeoPixel LED bars with coordinated animations across multiple nodes, no data wires required ([Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/WiFi-Mesh-Synchronized-LED-Bars/))
* **MeshyMcLighting** -- Standalone mesh-networked NeoPixel lighting system broadcasting state across nodes without internet connectivity ([MeshyMcLighting](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/debsahu/2018/05/20/meshymclighting-neopixels-lighting-solution-using-mesh-network/))
* **MQTT-to-Mesh gateways** -- Bridging painlessMesh IoT networks to MQTT brokers for cloud integration ([painlessMeshMqttGateway](https://github.com/latonita/painlessMeshMqttGateway))
* **Woodshop dust collector control** -- Distributed blast gate control across a workshop using mesh-networked ESP nodes
* **Smart agriculture and irrigation** -- Distributed soil moisture, temperature, and water flow monitoring across fields with a gateway node forwarding to cloud dashboards
* **Emergency/disaster communication** -- Pre-deployed ESP32 mesh networks that continue relaying status messages (water levels, power outages) when internet infrastructure is down
